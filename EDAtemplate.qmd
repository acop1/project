#1. Data Overview Dataset Structure: Check rows, columns, and data types.

Missing Values: Identify and handle missing data.

Basic Statistics: Summary stats (mean, median, min, max, etc.) for numerical variables.

Key Variables to Examine (Depending on Dataset) Match Data: Date, teams, score, venue, competition.

Team Data: Win/loss records, points scored/conceded, penalties.

Game Events: Kicks, lineouts, scrums, turnovers.

#2. Univariate Analysis Analyze individual variables to understand distributions.

Numerical Variables Distribution Plots: Histograms, boxplots (e.g., points scored, tackles made).

Key Metrics: Average points per match.

Categorical Variables Bar Charts:

Most frequent match outcomes (win/loss/draw).

Top teams by wins or points.

#3. Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis Examine relationships between variables.

Team Performance Win/Loss vs. Home/Away: Do teams perform better at home?

Score Difference Analysis: How often do matches have close margins?

Points Scored vs. Conceded: Defensive vs. offensive strength.

Correlation Analysis:

Does more possession lead to more points?

Are more penalties associated with losses?

#4. Time-Based Trends Seasonal Performance: Do teams perform better at certain times of the year?

Team Improvement/Decline: Win rate trends over seasons.


```{python loading_packages}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import os
```

```{python import_data}
rugbyDF = pd.read_csv("data/rugby.csv")
rugbyDF.shape
#(2783, 11)
```

```{python trimming_data}

#only keeping data after 1999
#will create a year col and then trim the data

rugbyDF['year'] = rugbyDF['date'].str[0:4].astype(int)
rugbyDF = rugbyDF[rugbyDF.year > 1998]
rugbyDF.shape
#new shape of dataframe: (1234,12)
```

```{python col_types}

for cols in rugbyDF.columns:
  print(cols + ": " + (str)(rugbyDF[cols].dtype))

#Since there are 2 numerical cols, i can get summary statistics on them
#year variable will not be taken into account for summary statistics
rugbyDF.describe()
```

We can observe that the mean points scored by the home team was approximately 4.2 higher than the away team. All major quadrants have higher points for home_score than away_score, and the std is also greater.
