# Rugby World Cup Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the winner of the 2027 Rugby World Cup by analyzing historical match data from tier-one rugby nations. The analysis focuses on team performance metrics such as win percentages, points scored/conceded, and home/away advantages to build predictive models.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Explores team performance trends from 1999 to 2024.
- **Visualizations**: Includes interactive plots for win percentages, scoring/conceding averages, and World Cup vs. non-World Cup performance.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses machine learning techniques (XGBoost, Random Forest, and Ordinal Logistic Regression) to forecast outcomes.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Simulates tournament scenarios to quantify uncertainty in predictions.

## Data Sources
- **Dataset**: Contains 2,783 international rugby matches, filtered to 1,230 matches post-1999 involving tier-one teams.
- **Variables**: Includes match dates, teams, scores, competition types, and derived metrics like win rates and point differentials.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Filtered matches post-1999 and tier-one teams.
   - Engineered features such as home/away win percentages and average points scored/conceded.
   - Created binary indicators for match outcomes.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized team performance over time.
   - Compared home vs. away performance and World Cup vs. non-World Cup metrics.

3. **Modeling**:
   - **XGBoost Classifier**: Predicts match winners with Monte Carlo simulations for uncertainty.
   - **Random Forest**: Identifies key performance indicators.
   - **Ordinal Logistic Regression**: Predicts tournament stages reached by teams.

## Key Insights
- **Dominant Teams**: New Zealand, South Africa, and Ireland show consistent high performance.
- **Home Advantage**: All teams perform significantly better at home.
- **World Cup Performance**: Some teams (e.g., Scotland) struggle under tournament pressure.

## Project Structure
- **`EDAtemplate.pdf`**: Contains detailed EDA and visualizations.
- **`Preliminary Analysis.html`**: HTML report of the analysis, including code and results.
- **Data**: Original and processed datasets (not included in this repository).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, `statsmodels`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to reproduce the analysis.

## Results
The model predicts the following probabilities for the 2027 Rugby World Cup winner:
- New Zealand: 16.0%
- England: 13.1%
- France: 12.4%
- South Africa: 11.5%
- Ireland: 11.4%
