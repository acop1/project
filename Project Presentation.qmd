# Introduction

-   **What is the Rugby World Cup (RWC)?**
    -   Premier international tournament held every four years.
-   **Research Question:** \> Can regular fixture performance since 1999 predict World Cup success for tier-one rugby nations?
-   **Motivation:**
    -   All champions have been tier-one nations.
    -   Use historical data to model success.

# Data Overview

-   **Source:** International rugby match dataset (1999â€“2024)
-   **Filtered Dataset:** 1,230 matches
    -   Tier-one teams only
    -   No missing values
-   **Variables:**
    -   Scores, home/away teams, competition type, match year
    -   Engineered features: win %, point differential, etc.

# Summary Statistics

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("Home Score", "Away Score"),
  Mean = c(25.07, 20.78),
  SD = c(13.15, 11.38)
)

knitr::kable(data)
```

-   Home win rate: **59.6%**
-   Away win rate: **38.4%**
-   Home advantage is statistically significant.

# Win Percentages by Team

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}
home_win <- c(87.1, 72.6, 70.8, 67.5, 66.2, 46.4, 41.1, 33.7, 13.5, 46.3)
away_win <- c(73.0, 45.5, 46.6, 38.0, 37.0, 33.0, 24.5, 26.6, 5.5, 33.0)
teams <- c("New Zealand", "South Africa", "England", "France", "Australia", "Wales", "Scotland", "Argentina", "Italy", "Ireland")
data <- data.frame(team = teams, home_win, away_win)

ggplot(data, aes(x = reorder(team, home_win))) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = home_win), stat="identity", fill="steelblue", position = position_nudge(y = -1), width = 0.4) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = away_win), stat="identity", fill="orange", position = position_nudge(y = 1), width = 0.4) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title="Home vs Away Win Percentages by Team", x="Team", y="Win Percentage (%)", fill="Location") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

-   **New Zealand** is dominant both home and away.
-   All teams perform better at home.
-   **Italy** underperforms consistently.

# Scoring vs. Conceding

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=5}
data <- data.frame(
  team = teams,
  home_scored = c(30, 28, 27, 25, 26, 23, 20, 22, 15, 26),
  away_scored = c(28, 24, 23, 21, 22, 19, 17, 19, 13, 24),
  home_conceded = c(15, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 25, 23, 27, 20),
  away_conceded = c(16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 24, 26, 22)
)

library(tidyr)
data_long <- pivot_longer(data, cols = -team, names_to = "metric", values_to = "value")

ggplot(data_long, aes(x = reorder(team, value), y = value, fill = metric)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Average Points Scored and Conceded (Home & Away)", x = "Team", y = "Points", fill = "Metric") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

-   High scoring teams (NZ, RSA) also concede fewer points.
-   Italy and Scotland struggle defensively.

# World Cup vs Regular Match Performance

-   **Ireland** and **South Africa** maintain strong form.
-   Teams like **Scotland** concede more during WC matches.
-   Highlights impact of tournament pressure.

# Modeling Approach

-   **XGBoost with Monte Carlo Simulations**
    -   Captures non-linearity and interactions
    -   100,000 simulations for probabilistic WC outcome predictions

# 2027 World Cup Predictions

-   **Top 3 Teams**:
    -   **New Zealand**: 16.2%
    -   **England**: 12.8%
    -   **France**: 12.5%
-   **Dark Horses**: Ireland, South Africa

# Conclusion

-   Regular fixture performance is a **reliable predictor** of RWC outcomes.
-   **Key Metrics**: Win %, scoring margin, form trends
-   Model accuracy: **78%**

# Future Work

-   Add **Elo ratings** for strength-adjusted comparisons
-   Integrate **player-level data** and injuries
-   Develop **interactive dashboards** for prediction scenarios

# Thank You
