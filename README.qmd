## Key Notes
- **Neutral Venues**: Matches where neither team is the "home" side (e.g., World Cup finals).
- **Historical Data**: Early records (pre-1950) may lack stadium/city details.
- **Scores**: Ties are recorded as equal values (e.g., `3-3`).

## Notes

Neutral Venue: A neutral venue is one where neither team is the home team (e.g., a tournament final held at a predetermined location).

World Cup Matches: The world_cup column flags matches that are part of the Rugby World Cup (e.g., True for World Cup games, False otherwise).

Historical Context: Some older matches may lack detailed metadata (e.g., stadium names or exact competition names).

## Potential Uses
Analyze historical trends in rugby performance.

Compare team performance across different competitions.

Study the evolution of rugby tournaments over time.

## Limitations
The dataset does not include player-level statistics or match events (e.g., tries, penalties).

Some early records may have missing or incomplete data.
