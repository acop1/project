Exploring the Data

-   World Cup performance: This can be measured in different ways, such as:

    -   Final placement (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)

    -   Knockout stage reached (Group Stage, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, etc.)

    -   Win percentage in the World Cup

    -   Number of points per match in World Cup games

Data Wrangling and Transformation

-   Filtering data: Keeping only matches from 1999 onward.

-   Merging datasets: We will assess both the World Cup datasets and non-World Cup datasets.

-   Creating new metrics (e.g., rolling averages, Elo ratings).

-   Creating new columns: For example, you might want to create a column that indicates whether a match was a knockout stage match or not.

-   Create a few new columns which may include:

   

-   Transforming categorical variables (e.g., converting team names into numerical indicators or factors).

-   Remove unnecessary columns if needed (e.g., if stadium or city is not part of your analysis).

        "The final position a team finishes in the tournament.",
        "The stage of the tournament a team reaches (e.g., Group Stage, Quarterfinals).",
        "The percentage of matches won by a team in the World Cup.",
        "The average number of points scored by a team per match in the World Cup.",
       
    ]
}
