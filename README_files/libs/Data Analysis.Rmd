Exploring the Data

-  World Cup performance: This can be measured in different ways, such as:

    -   Final placement (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.)

    -   Knockout stage reached (Group Stage, Quarterfinals, Semifinals, etc.)

    -   Win percentage in the World Cup

    -   Number of points per match in World Cup games

Data Wrangling and Transformation

- Filtering data: Keeping only matches from 1999 onward.

-   Merging datasets: If you have separate datasets for regular fixtures and World Cup matches, they need to be joined.

-   Creating new metrics (e.g., rolling averages, Elo ratings).

-   Transforming categorical variables (e.g., converting team names into numerical indicators or factors).


Remove unnecessary columns if needed (e.g., if stadium or city is not part of your analysis).
