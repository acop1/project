## Research Questions

Dataset 1: Since one of us is an avid sports fan and another is a rugby player, we want to combine our data science and sports knowledge to predict something exciting and important in the sporting world. Using game results from ordinary fixtures since 1999, we analyze whether a relationship exists between World Cup performances and regular fixture performances. Using a model, we predict the winner of the 2027 World Cup based on past data, comparing ordinary fixture performance with World Cup performance. The past 10 winners of the Rugby World Cup have all been among the tier-one menâ€™s teams, so we assume this trend will continue. Based on our analysis, we predict that RSA, IRE, or NZ will be crowned World Cup champions in 2027.
